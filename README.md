INFO ABOUT TB6560

1.Introduction
The TB6560-3 Axis Stepper Motor Driver is a excellent microstepping driver that use TOSHIBA
TB6560 Chip,based on pure-sine current control technology.Owing to the above technology and
the self-adjustment technology (self-adjust current control parameters) according to different
motors, the driven motors can run with smaller noise, lower heating, smoother movement and
have better performances at higher speed than most of the drives in the markets. It is suitable for
driving 2-phase and 4-phase hybrid stepping motors.



2.Features
 Low cost and good high-speed torque
 Supply voltage up to +32 VDC
 Output current up to 3.0A
 Pulse frequency up to 20 KHz
 Suitable for 2-phase and 4-phase motors
 Over-voltage and short-circuit protection
 7 output current choices, max 3200
steps/rev
 Automatic idle-current reduction

 Slim size (96x61x37mm) 


Applications
Suitable for a wide range of stepping motors from NEMA size 17 to 23. It can be used in various kinds of
machines, such as X-Y-Z tables, labeling machines, laser cutters, engraving machines,pick-place
devices, and so on. Particularly adapt to the applications desired with low vibration,high speed and high
precision.
